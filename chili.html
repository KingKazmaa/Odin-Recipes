        <figcaption>This chili recipe has the absolute best flavor combination. It’s so easy to put together, and from there it’s left to simmer, reduce, and concentrate. It incorporates simple flavor enhancers that make all the difference.</figcaption>

        <ol class="Steps">
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and let them soften for 8 minutes, stirring occasionally. (This allows them to release their natural sugars which is a nice offset to the acidity from the tomatoes. They also are very soft and subtle in the chili.)</li>
            <li>Season the ground beef with salt and pepper. Increase heat to medium-high. Add the ground beef and cook and crumble it for 5 minutes. Add the garlic and bell/jalapeno peppers and cook for 3 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain excess grease. Add the seasonings and toss to coat. Add the tomato paste, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce. Toss to season and coat the beef evenly.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken broth and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add the beef bouillon, crushed tomatoes, and diced tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover partially and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to lift any meat that has settled to the bottom. Stir in the drained kidney beans and simmer for 15 more minutes or until desired consistency is obtained.</li>
            <li>Taste and add seasonings as needed. Let it rest for 5 minutes prior to serving (with cornbread!), it will thicken even further.</li>
